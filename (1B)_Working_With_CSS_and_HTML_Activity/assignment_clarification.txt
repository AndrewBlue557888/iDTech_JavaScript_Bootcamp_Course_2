The assignment says "Update the ul and li styles to 
match the following design:"
but I can't see the image in my browser 
(if its the browser). 
I could still see the "final outcome" image, 
so I made it in such a way that it still 
looks like that, hope you don't mind if its 
a little different in those areas.

Also, since I could do a seperte background for 
[active]/"code" than the other items I made 
the backgroud of that item slightly different for 
further emphasis.
